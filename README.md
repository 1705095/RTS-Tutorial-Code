# RTS-Tutorial-Code
The code for my RTS video tutorials.

This code is for those following my RTS tutorials. The code will be updated semi-regularly as bugs are fixed and features are added. Each script contains detailed notes on what the script does and where to put it. This repository isn't meant to replace my videos but to allow you to compare your code with mine to work out bugs you may have.

This code isn't perfect and is constantly being changed so if you encounter any bugs or have any questions, comments, or suggestions please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or Discord. You can also email me at:

nixinteractive@yahoo.com

I hope this code is useful for you. Good luck!
